# Vue with Brunch

This is a Brunch skeleton made with [vuejs](http://vuejs.org) following plugins for [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) functionality:
* vue-resource
* vue-router
* vuex
* vuex-router-sync

## Getting started
* Install:
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`
* Run:
    * `npm start` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `npm build ` — builds minified project for production.
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/src` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
